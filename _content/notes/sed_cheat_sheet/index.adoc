= sed cheat sheet

https://man.archlinux.org/man/sed.1[sed(1)^]
is stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
It is a powerful tool to manipulate one ore more files, for example search
and replace.

This notes collect the cases that I use when using
https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/[GNU sed^].

== Replacing text

Case 1: replace "golang.org/src/pkg" with "go.dev/src" in all asciidoc
files,

----
$ find . -name "*.adoc" | xargs sed -i 's#golang.org/src/pkg#go.dev/src#g'
----

Since the text be searched contains "/" we use the character '#' as
separator, instead of common one "/".

Case 2: replace "http://" with "https://" but not on line that contains
"localhost" nor "127.0.0.1",

----
$ find . -name "*.adoc" | xargs sed -i '/\(localhost\|127.0.0.1\)/! s#http://#https://#g'
----
