=  A guide to readable and performance wise code

Most of the time code is about reading rather than writing.

//{{{
==  Always validate input

Most common error is from program that process input from user.

When writing a function or method, the top statement should be checking or
validating input, then followed by processing the input, and finally returning
the output from processing itself.

----
FUNCTION login(username, password) BOOLEAN
  // Check if username and password is not empty

  // Process login

  // Return the result of process
END FUNCTION
----


//}}}
//{{{
==  Use Constant

**Rationale:** using constant will minimize typo and provide easy refactoring.

Bad code example,

----
IF user == "administartor" THEN
END IF
----

will not print any error on build because typo on string.
But if we use constant there will be an error or at least a hint on our IDE
that the variable is undeclared.

Good code example,

----
const USER_ADMIN = "administrator"

IF user == USER_ADMIN THEN // OK
END IF
...
IF user == USER_ADNIN THEN // will return build error or hint (for example,
                           // red color or underscore) on our IDE.
END IF
----

//}}}
//{{{
==  Return first

Return first or return immediately is a concept to structuring our code to
minimize if-else statements which in turn minimize code indentation.

Bad code example,

----
login(user, password) boolean {
	if user is exist {
		if password is equal {
			return true
		} else {
			return false
		}
	}

	return false
}
----

Good code example,

----
login(user, password) boolean {
	if user is not exist {
		return false
	}
	if password is not equal {
		return false
	}

	return true
}
----

Programming challenges,

* Write IF without ELSE
* Write function body less than your screen size


//}}}
//{{{
==  Variable Naming

The name of variable should provide the context or data that their hold, it
should be concise, not more than three words.

For example, instead of client, add prefix or suffix to indicate what client
that variable hold for (tcpClient, httpClient, dbClient, dbc).


//}}}
//{{{
==  Never have loop or indentation deeper than two

If we need loop deeper than two, then the second or third loop or indentation
body should be moved to function.

At some point, we may have the following code in our function,

----
switch x {
case a:
	for ...
		if ...

case b:
	...
}
...
----

If body of "case a" may take more lines and indentations, that is an
indication that the body should be moved to their own function.


//}}}
==  On performance

//{{{
===  Memory is faster than disk

There are two component where you can store data: disk or memory.
Reading or writing data from disk is slower than memory.
Reading or writing from disk is slower but the data will be stored
permanently.
Reading or writing data from memory is faster than disk but they were
volatile.
To get the advantages from disk and memory (permanent and faster) the
technique is to load data from disk to memory at startup and store it again
later when finished or when data changed.

Common technique to sync data from disk to memory and vice versa,

. Load data from disk at startup
. Setup a timer, for example, for every 1 minute, dump data to disk only data
  is changing (e.g. have a dirty flag on each record)
. Dump data to disk when exit


//}}}
//{{{
===  Use integer for index/key instead of string

NOTE: This may not applicable to every programming language.
Some programming language may have optimization where string is compared
by bulk instead of per octet.

The naive algorithm for comparing two strings is actually works like these (*),

----
FUNCTION CMP_STRING(a STRING, b STRING) BOOLEAN
BEGIN
	IF LENGTH(a) != LENGTH(b) THEN
		RETURN false
	END IF

	x := 0
	FOR x := 0; x < LENGTH(a); x++; DO
		IF a[x] != b[x] THEN
			RETURN false
		END IF
	}
	RETURN true;
END;
----

The worst case for above algorithm is `O(n)` where string is equally
matched, and the best case is `O(1)` where their length are different.

This is an example of bad code using string as key,

----
Record {
	key string
	value string
}

...

IF r.key == "person" THEN
	...
END;

SWITCH r.key {
CASE "person":
	...
CASE "alien":
	...
}
----

We can refactor the key to use constant and integer and still make the code
readable,

----
ENUM RecordType {
	PERSON: 0
	ALIEN: 1
}

Record {
	key RecordType
	value string
}


IF r.key == RecordType.PERSON
	...
END;

SWITCH r.key {
case RecordType.PERSON:
	...
case RecordType.ALIEN:
	...
}
----


//}}}
//{{{
===  Use temporary variable

There are two common cases where using variable make the code more readable
and faster.
The first case is by storing each return function call to temporary variable
instead of chaining them;
the second case is by storing each computation in temporary variable.

Bad example of first case,

----
doX(doY(x, y))
----

In the above example, call to function `doX` based on return value of function
`doY`.
It may give clear statement because in the example the function name is short,
but we recommended if we split them into two statements,

----
y = doY(x, y)
doX(y)
----

Bad example of second case,

----
a = y + z*10
b = doB(z*10)
----

It is common that I found sometimes the same computation is declared more than
once on the same function.
In this case is "z*10".
We can rewrite the function by storing known computation into temporary
variable,

----
tmp := z * 10
a = y + tmp
b = doB(tmp)
----

Note that, some compilers may or may not how to optimize the static computation
depends on the type of `z`.


//}}}
//{{{
===  Use string concatenation instead of Printf

**Rationale:** printf-like statement require parsing formatted parameter,
checking the "%x" input with type of arguments, and then converting back to
string.
Logically, it will use more operations than concatenation because its happened
at compile time.

This is may vary between programming language, but in most case using "+" is
faster that "Printf" or join function.

For Go, see the following benchmark.

===  Prevent using regex if possible

Technically, regular expression or regex actually is a meta language.
They need to be parsed and checked; and when doing processing of input
require reading each octet from beginning until end.

Using regex on testing is make sense to match the output with expected case,
in case output is arbitrary and require their own parsing.
