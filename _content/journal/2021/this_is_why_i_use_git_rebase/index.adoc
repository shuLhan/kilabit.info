= This is why I use git rebase

Suppose that we use three branches, one for development (`main`), one for
testing (`staging`), and one for live (`production`); and one time you need to
quickly push a commit to production to quick fix somethings.

Someone then create a commit to fix it, push to main, another one review it
and merge to main and then to staging.
The code then deployed to staging environment, where quality assurance (QA)
make sure that the fix is correct, probably for the third times.

QA approve it, the maintainer then merge them to production.

This is what the history looks like with git merge,

is why I do not use git merge].

Of course, one can use `gitk \--no-merges` to preview the history with less
clutters but it does not hide the merge commits.

If one use git rebase, the history is clean and linear, we don't have three
"Merge xxx" only single commit from the fix,

== _Does it matter?_

It depends.
If you value the history of your project, it matter.

There are several advantages when using linear git history.

First, the obvious reason is it give a calm sensation for some people brains.

Second, when your application break and you did not know what cause it, you may
depends on the git history to review the code again on specific path or file
that may cause it.
The quick ways maybe using `git blame`, but its require two steps: running git
blame and searching the offending commit.
Sometimes reviewing commit by commit can be helpful, since we already knew
what the commit does and when, so we can skip some commits and jump to
specific commits for reviewing.

Third, one can manage commits into several branches.
All commits goes to `master`, some commits that is ready for testing goes to
`staging`, and commits that has been tested and ready to be release goes to
`production`.

Once in a while, the maintainer rebase the `staging` branch to `main` and
`production` to `staging`, which result in clean single line history.

== A critic to git(hub) flow

There is https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/[an article]
circulating and has been suggested to me, twice, where the author suggest that
each feature should be developed on its branch and merged back to `develop`
branch when it's ready for release.

There are two things that irks me about the article.

First, people seems completely miss the point of git.
The building block of git is commits, and commits is about history.
Branch is another way to collect the commits as part of the workflow.
By putting emphasis only on branch, people seems ignore important point on
how to create link:/notes/A_guide_to_version_control[a good git commit], which
in effect causes one line commit behaviour (also, the GUI tools for Git user
even encourage this behaviour, for example VS Code, Github desktop).

Second, a feature developed on a branch and merged to `develop` is assumed to
be perfect, non-free bugs code.
Suppose that we have three features being merged to `develop` branch: F1, F2,
and F3.
What would happen if one the feature has bug?
Let say F1 has a bug, F2 is pass the QA, and F3 missing some requirements.
Do we create another branch for that?
`F1-fix` and `F3-update`?
And merge them again?
Can we just release only F2 first?
No, the article seems to suggest to wait for F1 and F3 complete before going
for release.

Another
https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/[article about github flow] also
has this defect, but this one paragraph even more harmful than later, emphasis
on mine,

[quote]
Once your pull request has been reviewed and the branch passes your tests, you
can deploy your changes to verify them in production. _If your branch causes
issues, you can roll it back by deploying the existing main branch into
production._

Is not that cute?
It seems like an issue is a new normal on github platform, "Hey we lost our
client money because the latest release forgot to add the user balance, lets
roll back to previous main branch".
No github, we should not rollback, we move forward by fixing the issue, so the
history know what we do wrong in the past and how to fix it.
