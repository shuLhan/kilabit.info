=  Building Docker Image with Arch Linux

If you happen to be a Archer fanatic, you may want everything run on Arch
Linux instead of any other distro.
That's including me.

When creating your own docker image, there are two options.
One, use existing docker image.
Two, roll your own docker image.

For the first option they are several base images that already exits in docker
hub, you can try to search them in https://hub.docker.com.

For the second option, you can create your own rootfs, either manually from
scratch or using script which is already provided by package
arch-install-script.
I use option two, with some modification.

My modification to pacstrap is,

which can be seen in line beginning with '+'.
What its do is copying pacman database from host to chroot fs to minimize
network IO when building image.


==  Steps

In this process I use `zsh` for scripting because its easy when working with
arrays.
Here is the procedure to create rootfs using pacstrap,

(1) List packages we want to install in a variable PKGS.

----
$ export PKGS=(coreutils sed gzip)
----

`sed` and `gzip` is used for generating locale, we can remove it later.

(2) Create empty directory for rootfs, e.g. ROOTFS

----
$ export ROOTFS=arch-rootfs
$ mkdir $ROOTFS
----

(2.1) mount it as tmpfs, for speeding up read/write operation.

----
$ mount -t tmpfs -o size=400MB tmpfs $ROOTFS
----

(3) Run pacstrap using ROOTFS and pass the PKGS as the parameters.

----
$ sudo pacstrap.sh -c -d $ROOTFS $PKGS
----

The '-c' option is mandatory its mean use package cache in host rather than in target.

(4) Do something with ROOTFS (set hostname, locales, copying configuration files, cleaning, etc.)

The following steps can be running inside the rootfs using "arch-chroot $CHROOT" or directly from host. We will use the first option.

----
$ arch-chroot $ROOTFS /bin/sh
----

(4.1) Set hostname

----
# echo ${HOSTNAME} > /etc/hostname
----

(4.2) Set timezone

----
# cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC /etc/localtime
----

(4.3) Set locales

----
# echo "en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8" > /etc/locale.gen
# echo "en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8" >> /etc/locale.gen

# /usr/bin/locale-gen

# echo "==> set locale preferences ..."
# echo "LANG=en_GB.UTF-8"    >  "$rootfs"/etc/locale.conf
# echo "LC_MESSAGES=C"        >> "$rootfs"/etc/locale.conf
----

(5) Create the docker image.

----
sudo tar --numeric-owner --xattrs --acls -C "$ROOTFS" -c . |
        docker import - yourname/yourimagename
----

Easy enough is not it? Well, here come the hardest part.


==  Cleaning the ROOTFS

Now, after you inspect the resulting image you see their size is quite big:

----
ms 0 % sudo du -sch $ROOTFS
200M    arch-rootfs
200M    total
----

We see that most of space is taken by "/usr" directory.
Let see how the space spread in there,

----
ms 0 % sudo du -hd 1 $ROOTFS/usr | sort -h
0       arch-rootfs/usr/local
0       arch-rootfs/usr/src
11M     arch-rootfs/usr/bin
12M     arch-rootfs/usr/include
82M     arch-rootfs/usr/share
88M     arch-rootfs/usr/lib
192M    arch-rootfs/usr
----

What should we do?

First `bin` and `lib` directory. We will make sure that all binaries and
libraries is stripped.
Stripped binary/library will decrease their size.

----
$ sudo find $ROOTFS/usr/bin -type f \( -perm -0100 \) -print |
        xargs file |
        sed -n '/executable .*not stripped/s/: TAB .*//p' |
        xargs -rt strip --strip-unneeded

$ sudo find $ROOTFS/usr/lib -type f \( -perm -0100 \) -print |
        xargs file |
        sed -n '/executable .*not stripped/s/: TAB .*//p' |
        xargs -rt strip --strip-unneeded
----

Second, include directory.
If your future image does not need compilation, you can remove all of them.
I repeat again.
If your future workflow does not need compilation, you can remove content in
the "include" directory.

Third, the share directory.
Let see their content,

----
ms 0 % sudo du -hd 1 $ROOTFS/usr/share | sort -h
[sudo] password for ms:
0       arch-rootfs/usr/share/misc
4,0K    arch-rootfs/usr/share/makepkg-template
16K     arch-rootfs/usr/share/tabset
40K     arch-rootfs/usr/share/licenses
80K     arch-rootfs/usr/share/readline
1,7M    arch-rootfs/usr/share/info
3,5M    arch-rootfs/usr/share/iana-etc
3,7M    arch-rootfs/usr/share/doc
4,5M    arch-rootfs/usr/share/zoneinfo
6,6M    arch-rootfs/usr/share/terminfo
9,7M    arch-rootfs/usr/share/i18n
11M     arch-rootfs/usr/share/man
16M     arch-rootfs/usr/share/locale
26M     arch-rootfs/usr/share/perl5
82M     arch-rootfs/usr/share
----

The "doc", "license", "locale", "man", "info", "zoneinfo", "iana-etc", and
"readline" is save to remove.

The "i18n" is a bit tricky, you should only remove the file that you don't
need for locale.

Script to remove all charmaps except UTF-8.

----
# find $ROOTFS/usr/share/i18n/charmaps/ \! -name "UTF-8.gz" -delete
----

Script to remove all locales except en_GB and en_US.

----
find $ROOTFS/usr/share/i18n/locales/ \! -name "en_GB" \! -name "en_US" -delete
----

The last directory is terminfo.
After searching and reading I found that not all terminfo is used, so we will
remove all except common terminfo,

----
#  find $ROOTFS/usr/share/terminfo/ \
        \! -name ansi \
        \! -name cygwin \
        \! -name linux \
        \! -name screen-256color \
        \! -name vt100 \
        \! -name vt220 \
        \! -name xterm \
        -delete
----

After all of this cleaning we got the final image to,

----
~/Workspaces/docker/arch-test
ms 0 % sudo du -sch arch-rootfs        
144M    arch-rootfs
144M    total
----

144MB, that was not bad at all but still big for rootfs.
Here is the dependencies of all installed packages,

----
     linux-api-headers <-\
iana-etc <- filesystem <- glibc <- ncurses <- readline <- bash <- gmp <- coreutils
                       gcc-libs <-/                  zlib <- openssl <-/
                                         db, gdbm <- perl <-/
                                                         attr <- acl <-/
                                                              libcap <-/
----

Want more extreme size? Force remove package less, sed, gzip, perl, db, and gdbm.

----
$ sudo pacman -r $ROOTFS -Rdd --noconfirm less sed gzip perl db gdbm
----

and we got,

----
ms 0 % sudo du -sch arch-rootfs
87M     arch-rootfs
87M     total
----

Small enough.
We can compare it with latest Centos image [1] which is around 63 MB, we still
left around 20 MB behind.


==  Conclusion

Finding and creating the smallest possible base docker image using Arch Linux
is possible, with minimum size roughly around ~90 MB, and it depends on your
use case or how do want the image to be used.
You don't need Dockerfile to do it.
In my use case I prefer not to installing pacman in image, if I want to create
an image for another use case, I will just run pacstrap and install all the
required packages.
For example, here is image for postgresql, redis, nodejs:

----
REPOSITORY                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
sulhan/arch-sailsjs        latest              2eb953910b73        13 minutes ago      438.3 MB
sulhan/arch-nodejs         latest              ac73cf5c1d36        17 minutes ago      351.6 MB
sulhan/arch-redis          latest              a2de7d62a807        21 minutes ago      100.5 MB
sulhan/arch-postgresql     latest              5568162e33a0        29 minutes ago      129.6 MB
sulhan/arch-base           latest              2af8f94bb6b7        41 minutes ago      86.92 MB
----

After pushing to my docker hub [3], I am a little bit surprise that the
website said that for my arch-base the image size is 32 MB instead of 86 MB
[4], and my arch-postgresql is only 49 MB not 128 MB.
I have no idea why they were different.

If we want a better lightweight image, not just in docker but in normal
system, while still using Arch, there is no other way than modified the
original package, i.e. splitting between doc, devel, and locales; and minimize
the dependencies between packages by splitting them into only more specific
function.
For example, sha*sum binaries could be split into openssl-tools, not as part
of coreutils.
If only the Arch package maintainers care about size and function, this would
be easy since the start, no manual cleaning and no force-remove packages.

If you want a better lightweight image for your docker, there is no other way
than stiching it by hand and create it manually using rootfs.

The source code for all scripts is in github [2].
