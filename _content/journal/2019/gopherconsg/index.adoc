Sad.
But its OK!

My first day of GopherCon is going to workshop at Google Singapore.

Actually, this is second day of three days workshop.
I can afford only for single day, so I chose the Dave's session.
The instructor is Mr. Dave "Druid" Cheney ;)
He gave a talk about
https://dave.cheney.net/practical-go/presentations/qcon-china.html[Practical
Go: Real world advice for writing maintainable Go programs], which is
available on his website, for free.
A truly druid.

The final day, the conference, is at Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention
Centre.
There are probably more than 500 gophers attending there,
not only from South East Asia, also from Japan, Austria, and Russia.

I met so many awesome people there, enthusiastic gophers, and even
people from @ardanlabs and Go team.

Some of the talks I like are from Jacob Walker,
