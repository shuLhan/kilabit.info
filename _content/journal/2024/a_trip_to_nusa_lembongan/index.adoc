https://maps.app.goo.gl/bGCFxE8aRm3ZSgda6[Lembongan^]
or Nusa Lembongan is small island at the south east of Bali, or on the
north west of Nusa Penida.

NOTE: the word "nusa" in Bahasa Indonesia is equal to "island" in
English.

We go to Nusa Lembongan at the end of December, to celebrate the New
Year of 2023.

We arrived on Bali at I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport.
From there we pay 275 IDR for travel to
https://maps.app.goo.gl/fGK81Zf3JTFGJaSM7[Sanur Harbour^].
From Sanur Harbour we take a fast boat to
https://maps.app.goo.gl/ApeFiQvnDTxmqd3J8[Mushroom Bay^]
with ticket price is around 100K/person (local only, for foreign
tourist it may around 250K).

There are three islands near Nusa Lembongan: Bali (the big one, on the
west), Nusa Ceningan (the small island on the south), and Nusa Penida
(another big island on the south east).
If you stay either at Nusa Lembongan, Nusa Ceningan, or at the west of Nusa
Penida, you can visit the other two islands by boat (not a car
though).
You can use motor bike from Nusa Lembongan to Nusa Ceningan, but not
to Nusa Penida.

Most of the places that we visit are in Nusa Lembongan, some in Nusa
Ceningan.
Both are beautiful places.


== Where did we stay?

video::/assets/journal/2024/a_trip_to_nusa_lembongan/dlicks_villa_lembongan.mp4[D'Licks Villa Lembongan,width=320,role=right]

Since this is our first trip to Nusa Lembongan,
we did not know the area or where to visit, so we pick the one that
match with our budget for seven days.
After several consideration we choose
https://maps.app.goo.gl/ba23UC2pqvUnmnNZ8[D'Licks Villa Lembongan^],
which is located in the main (most populated) area of Lambongan.

To be honest, we are not expecting much.
But, when we got there, it's beyond our expectation, and we love it.
We stay on private bungalow, with spacious bathroom.
The outdoor view is beautiful with various plants and a swimming pool.

Things that you need to know, the distance between Mushroom Bay and
our villa is quite far (around 3.6 KM) so one need to take a local
taxi to go there or rent a bike.

This villa is located quite far from main road, but still walkable, to
nearest beach (Jungutbatu beach) or restaurants.

Nusa Lembongan is not as crowded like Bali, also there is local
curfew, most of the cafes, shops, or restaurants usually close after
10 PM, excepts some bars and mini markets.
So, you can stay anywhere in this island or the nearest island,
Ceningan.


== Transportation

If you can drive a motor bike, there are many public rentals when you
arrive at Mushroom Bay.
Its around ~70K IDR per day, for local, I am not sure the price for
foreign tourist, probably around 120-150K per day.

You can also rent or call a local taxi.
If you need a car, ask their number or any contacts that can help you
drive here and there when visiting the island.
For the price, my apologize, that we did not know about it.
Remember that this is an open pick up (or mini truck) taxi, not like
uptown taxi with four doors.


== What places did we visit?

Most of the places that we visit are beaches, cafes, and restaurants.
On the last day, we do snorkeling at several best snorkeling places
in Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida.


=== Jungutbatu beach

image::/assets/journal/2024/a_trip_to_nusa_lembongan/jungutbatu_beach.jpg[Jungutbatu beach,320,role=left]

Jungutbatu beach is the nearest beach from our villa.
It is the longest beach, we think, in the Lembongan.

On the sunset, you can take a 20-40 minutes walk from the east to
the north, back and forth, or sit in one of the cafes or restaurants
around there to, relish on the beautiful sunset.

There are couple of boats harbor here, probably private boats.
The sea water is quite clear, you can take a swim here.
Be careful though, some areas is little deeps after several meters
from the shore.


=== Mushroom bay beach

https://maps.app.goo.gl/jgSk3nehEVxbthfYA[Google Maps^].

When you arrived at Nusa Lembongan, your boat harbor at the Mushroom
Bay.
There are several boats anchored there.
Several meters to the north there are clear area where people take
sunbathe and dripping.
There are also cafes, hotels with restaurant up there.

The water is not quite clear, due to many boats comes and go, but you
can still dip and swim here.


=== Devil's tears

https://maps.app.goo.gl/bqdm171xREJYCNoD7[Google Maps^].

image::/assets/journal/2024/a_trip_to_nusa_lembongan/devils_tears.jpg[Devils's tears,width=320,role=right]

Devil's tears is the area where the wave meets rocky cliffs.
Some said, when the waves are big it will create a high splash, like a
devil's tear ;)
This place is guarded by local people, due to maintenance and high
risk around the area, so you will need to pay entrance fee.
For local, if memory serve me right, its around 25K IDR, for foreign
tourist I think its around 50K IDR.

Most people see the big splash here, or watch the sunset or walk
around to see the sea from the top.

Anyway, from here you can walk to Dream beach.
 

=== Dream beach

image::/assets/journal/2024/a_trip_to_nusa_lembongan/dream_beach_from_the_top.jpg[Dream beach,width=420,role=left]

Dream beach is one of the famous beach in Nusa Lembongan.
It has big wave, blue water, almost white sands, still with coral
reef.
 

=== Secret Point beach

https://maps.app.goo.gl/14pYkFD3xnbfkM5A7[Google Maps^].

image::/assets/journal/2024/a_trip_to_nusa_lembongan/secret_point_beach.jpg[Secret Point beach,width=420,role=right]

As the name suggest, this beach is surrounded by hotels and villas.
So, one need to park at Suku Beach Club, and go down to visit the
beach.
Or one can hang out at Suku Beach Club, with minimum payments, get a
drink or small bites, and enjoy the sunbathe.

This beach also not too crowded, have clear water and quite big waves.


=== Coconut beach

https://maps.app.goo.gl/eTmpCFMVMrqMyWv6A[Google Maps^].

image::/assets/journal/2024/a_trip_to_nusa_lembongan/coconut_beach.jpg[Coconut beach,width=420,role=left]

Coconut beach is also quite hidden.
Small beach, many people there, but not too crowded, maybe 15-25
peoples scattered around.

First we go there by a motor bike, taking round and park at Lembongan
Cliff Villas.
Turns out you can go there by walking from Lembogan Beach, go up,
follow the wooden trail to the west.

In this beach, you can rent surf board, a canoe, or swimming.


=== Tamarind beach

https://maps.app.goo.gl/P2soMWtsQH1kniU76[Google Maps^].

image::/assets/journal/2024/a_trip_to_nusa_lembongan/tamarind_beach.jpg[Tamarind beach,width=420,role=right]

Tamarind beach is one of my favourite, because not many people there,
no cafes or restaurants (at that times).
When we arrive there are like one couple and three kids swimming
there.
The water is clear, you can snorkeling, there are many coral reef
around and seaweeds.

When you walk around past the rocky area, there is another hidden
temple and beach there.


=== Snorkeling at Manta point and other places

image::/assets/journal/2024/a_trip_to_nusa_lembongan/manta_point.jpg[Manta point,width=420,role=left]

Thanks to
https://maps.app.goo.gl/EvpHkTrqLNXixzcm6[Captain Coconut Snorkeling^]
we can see Manta and turtle on one visit.

== Where/what do we eat?

There are quiet many places that we eats, but not many of them we can
recommend.
Some of those that we likes, we list it here.
Some of those that we did not like, either too pricey or the services
are not good, we will not list here.
We will not mention the names to bring the negativity, just look it up
on Google Maps, most of the stars and reviews are quite
representative.


=== Warung Bambu

https://maps.app.goo.gl/RSgC5UHrHrTGywDdA[Google Maps^]

image::/assets/journal/2024/a_trip_to_nusa_lembongan/warung_bambu.jpg[Warung Bambu,120,role=left]

In Indonesia, even if the fish are almost the same, the way they cook
and provides _sambal_ (chilli sauce or condiment) usually unique.
When we visit a beach, we always eat at local sea food restaurant on
the first dinner.

Warung Bambu is small restaurant, not too fancy, and not too pricey
either.
Good services, the taste is match with our tongues.
Also, sea food always taste better when you eat it near beach with sea
scent.


=== D'Byas Dream Beach Club And Villa

https://maps.app.goo.gl/z34nYDcgttjq8W96A[Google Maps^].

image::/assets/journal/2024/a_trip_to_nusa_lembongan/dbyas_dream_beach_resto.jpg[D'Byas dream beach restaurant,width=420,role=right]

Although the name is beach club, they have an open restaurant near the
Dream beach.


=== The Beach Shack

Good place, great view, with live music on afternoon sunset.
A little bit pricey, but overall nice place.


=== Ginger & Jamu

image::/assets/journal/2024/a_trip_to_nusa_lembongan/ginger_and_jamu__sandwich.jpg[Sandwich at Ginger and Jamu,width=420,role=right]

This is one of our favorite places near the beach.
We can swim up there, take a rest, and enjoy the rest of the sunset.

image::/assets/journal/2024/a_trip_to_nusa_lembongan/pondok_baruna.jpg[Pondok Baruna at Nusa Lembongan,height=420,role=right]

My wife order nasi campur and I order meat cooked with balinese
recipes.
The taste is matched with our local tongues, but the portions
are too much for our local belly ;)
Takes some times to eat the whole dinner, we did not want to waste it
either.


=== Warung Tumpang Sari Lembongan

image::/assets/journal/2024/a_trip_to_nusa_lembongan/rma_masakan_padang_lembongan.jpg[RMA Masakan padang,width=320,role=right]

As a native Minang, I can say the taste is still original, does not
try to adapt to local or tourist tongues.
We actually goes to this place twice.

Overall the food are delicious, the place only need some cleaning up,
especially the toilet.
Tarimo kasih banyak uda antoq.


=== Agus Shipwreck Bar & Restaurant

Previously, we try to visit Ohana's Beach club, but the party a little
bit off.
So we walk around to find another place, and finally, the place that
we spend for the new year eve: Agus Shipwreck Bar and Restaurant.

Thank you for the party!

(My apologize that the video is a little bit off, you know why).

See you again in the next year party.
