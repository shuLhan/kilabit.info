=  Why Google

"Starting with just one page, www.google.com has become a billion dollars
company now"

Why you should use Google (and its applications),

*  https://www.google.com/[What You Search Is What You Get^]
*  https://mail.google.com/[Gmail^], 7+ GB email storage, with less spam, and
   still counting for additional free space
*  \https://pages.google.com - Google Pages, 100 MB personal pages
   (out of service, replaced with
   https://sites.google.com[Google Sites^])
*  https://picasaweb.google.com - PicasaWeb, 250 MB photo album.
