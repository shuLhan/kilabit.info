Here we go again, another new year, 2025.
Lets review what I have done in the past year.

== Personal life

Well, I got new job last year, not in startup but one of the biggest home
appliances in South East Asia, as full-time contractors.
The office is in Jakarta, so I need to get back-and-forth between Jakarta
and Bandung during weekend.
Thanks got we got high-speed rail now in Indonesia, so the times from
Jakarta-Bandung now takes half a hour instead of three hours.


== asciidoctor-go

https://sr.ht/~shulhan/asciidoctor-go/[asciidoctor-go^]
is the Go module to parse the AsciiDoc markup and convert it into HTML5.
This project has 24 commits and three releases.

* asciidoctor-go v0.5.2 (2023-04-04)
+
This release only contains chores.

** Replace module "share" with "pakakeh.go"
+
The "share" module has been moved to new repository with new name at
"https://sr.ht/~shulhan/pakakeh.go".
For more information see the change logs at "pakakeh.go" module.

** Comply with linter recommendations
+
Most of the code changes related to refactoring if-else witch switch
statement.

** Replace if-else bytes.Equals with static string case comparisons
+
Using string instead of [bytes.Equal] give code much more readable.


* asciidoctor-go v0.6.0 (2024-09-07)

** Rename struct "AttributeEntry" to "DocumentAttribute"
+
This is to make the struct is clear that it represent the document
attribute.

** Rename struct "AttributeEntry" to "DocumentAttribute"
+
This is to make the struct is clear that it represent the document
attribute.

** Refactoring DocumentAttribute into struct
+
Using struct limit the value to only string, while some attributes can
be an integer value, for example "leveloffset".

** Support document attribute "leveloffset"
+
The ":leveloffset:" on document attribute allow increment or decrement
the heading level on included files.
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/include-with-leveloffset/[Reference^]

** Use strict document header format
+
Previously, an empty line before Document Title cause the parser stop
parsing the document header, now an empty lines are skipped.
Also document attribute can be place anywhere, either before or after
title, and in between attributes; now it can be only placed after
revision or author or title.

** Remove unnecessary TrimRight
+
Each lines to be parsed has been trimmed on the first load, so there
is no need to do it again, on some cases.


* asciidoctor-go v0.6.1 (2024-12-08)

** Fix error log when failed to open included file::
+
The log use the wrong variable when printing path for failed include
file.

** Fix reading include file when parent path is absolute::
+
Previously, if the parent document is opened using absolute path and
it contains include directive, the included file will fail to read
because the parent path is joined with current working directory.


== awwan

https://sr.ht/~shulhan/awwan/[awwan^]
is a command-line interface (CLI) to shell script, that can execute multiple
lines of commands in local or remote server using shell or SSH.
This project has 28 commits and four releases.


* awwan v0.11.0 (2024-01-06)
+
--
In this release we create https://tour.awwan.org where user can try and
learn awwan using step-by-step tutorial.

In the web-user interface (WUI) we add functionality to stop the local or
SSH execution.
--

** ake the magic line "#put:" use explicit source for encrypted file
** wui: implement button to stop execution
** Implement HTTP API to stop local or play execution
** Check script file is a directory
** Fix panic due to out of range when running "#require" statement
** Delete the execution response and context cancellation on finished
** Change the remote temporary directory to "~/.cache/awwan"


* awwan v0.12.0 (2024-02-08)

** Refactoring "env-set" arguments
+
--
Previously, the "env-set" take the file argument as the last argument
and optional.
This changes move the file argument to the first argument so the bash
completion can detect and print the completion for list of keys.

While at it, fix handling key with quoted in EnvSet and EnvGet.
--

** Refactoring env-get command
+
This changes the order of arguments of env-get command to pass the
directory first before the key.
The reason is to simplify auto-completion later from the command line.
--

** Add command env-keys
+
The "env-keys" command print list of environment variables under a
directory.
This command is internal, not documented, used by bash completion.

** Add bash completion script
+
Using awwan from CLI now can automatically complete the arguments based on
the command and current parameter number.


* awwan v0.12.1 (2024-04-05)
+
--
This release replace module "share" with "pakakeh.go".

In the "_wui", we use shared static assets from Cloud Storage.
The idea is to minimize noise in the logs that does not related to page
access and minimize binary size.

In the "_ops", we use shared mkosi cache in userâ€™s home ".cache".
This is to minimize duplicate files and allow us to find or grep files
without excluding certains directory.

We also apply some recommendations from linters.
--


* awwan v0.12.2 (2024-09-08)

** Replace licensing format to REUSE.toml
+
Using ".reuse/dep5" has been deprecated since REUSE v3.2.0.

** Update wui submodule URL
+
The wui submodule has been renamed to "pakakeh.ts".


== bin.sh

https://git.sr.ht/~shulhan/bin.sh[bin.sh^] is collection of my shell
scripts.
This project has seven commits with notable features and bug fixes,

* use the pkg-config to derive bash completion install directory
* tmux-session: skip line start with "#"
* add script "gen-password.sh"
+
The gen-password.sh is shell script to generate random words from
Indonesian directory of hunspell.
The hunspell-id package can be installed from AUR:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hunspell-id-git

* add script timer.sh.
  The timer.sh display a message after X duration.


== ciigo

https://sr.ht/~shulhan/ciigo/[ciigo^]
is a library and a program to write static web server with embedded files
using AsciiDoc and Markdown markup format
This project has 44 commits with six releases.


* ciigo v0.12.0 (2024-04-04)
+
--
Add server option to automatically generate index HTML.
If the requested path is directory and no "index.html" file exist in
that directory, ciigo server will render list of files as "index.html"
automatically.

Replace module "share" with "pakakeh.go".
The "share" module has been moved to new repository with new name at
"https://sr.ht/~shulhan/pakakeh.go".
--

* ciigo v0.13.0 (2024-05-12)
+
--
Add flag to set package and variable name for "embed".
The flag "-package-name" can be used to changes the default package
name inside the Go embed file. The flag "-var-name" can be used to
changes the default memfs variable name inside the Go embed file.

Fix HTML files always generated when HTMLTemplate is not set.
If the path to HTMLTemplate option is not set, GoEmbed should convert
to HTML only if markup file is newer than HTML file or when HTML file
not exist.

Initialize memfs using New.
When memfs not initialized using New, the [memfs.MemFS.PathNodes]
will be nil. This cause any Get on new file will return 404.
--

* ciigo v0.13.1 (2024-08-04)
+
--
Fix "serve" not detecting new files.
If there is new files on the root of directory it will not detected
automatically. This release now fix this issue.
--

* ciigo v0.13.2 (2024-09-07)
+
--
Support document attribute "leveloffset".
The ":leveloffset:" on document attribute allow increment or decrement
the heading level on included files.
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/include-with-leveloffset/[Reference^]

Use strict document header format.
Previously, an empty line before Document Title cause the parser
stop parsing the document header, now an empty lines are skipped.
Also document attribute can be place anywhere, either before or after
title, and in between attributes; now it can be only placed after
revision or author or title.
--

* ciigo v0.14.0 (2024-10-06)
+
--
Refactoring functions to accept non pointer struct option.
The function that accept struct XxxOptions should only received the
copy of struct, not pointer.

Introduce new type Ciigo.
The Ciigo type provides customizable and reusable instance of ciigo
for embedding, converting, and/or serving HTTP server. This type is
introduced so one can add HTTP handler or endpoint along with serving
the files.

Set margin on sectlevel3, sectlevel4, sectlevel5.
Using default margin (1.25rem) cause the TOC for level 3 until 5 have
wide gap in between them.
--

* ciigo v0.15.0 (2025-01-08)
+
--
This is the first major release of ciigo on the new year of 2025.
We bring many enhancements and update on the documentation.

[ENHANCEMENT]
The first changes is refactoring to use watchfs/v2. The [watchfs/v2]
bring new enhancements by watching only single file instead of all
markup files for changes. This minimize number of goroutine calling
[os.Stat] on each markup files.

[BUG FIX]
When listing the file markups, if the node is symlink (either file or
directory) and target its not exist, continue to the next node instead
of returning error. The same is true for directory that cannot be
opened, probably due to broken symlink or permission.

[ENHANCEMENT]
In development mode, where [ServeOptions.IsDevelopment] is set to true
or when running "ciigo serve", the ciigo HTTP server will check if the
new markup file is newer than HTML file when user press refresh or
reload on the browser. If its newer, it will convert the markup file and
return the new content of HTML file.

This allow quick preview without waiting for watcher to complete.

[ENHANCEMENT]
The README has been revamped to include section on how to install ciigo
as program, how to running ciigo convert and serve, how to write content
and view it live on browser, and how to deploy it.

On the section "ciigo as library" we point the user the sample code at
"internal/cmd/ciigo-example" instead of writing long code at the front.

[BUG FIX]
This release also fix Exclude option does not get processed when calling
GoEmbed, or running "ciigo embed".

This project receive 13 commits.
Some notables changes,

* content: tambahkan artikel tentang Generik
+
--
Artikel Generik berisi dua bagian:

* Parameter tipe: contoh penggunaan parameter tipe pada fungsi generik
* Tipe generik: contoh struktur data generik

Perubahan ini berdasarkan golang.org/x/website@b970f4b5b0 .
--

* content/basics: hapus keterangan tentang deterministik
+
--
Sejak Go 1.20, paket "math/rand" tidak perlu memanggil [rand.Seed] lagi
karena telah otomatis diinisialisasi oleh runtime.
Perubahan ini berdasarkan golang.org/x/website@2e65c647b00d
--

* local: disable opening browser automatically by default
+
When the program run using system service, in the background, we did not
want it to open browser automatically.

* Tambah flag untuk mengatur Origin dari koneksi WebSocket
+
Misalnya, jika httpListen di set ke "127.0.0.1:10201" dan servis berjalan
dibelakang sebuah proksi dengan domain "tour.golang-id.local", koneksi
ke WebSocket akan ditolak, karena pada saat handshake origin dari request
dicocokan dengan host dan port dari httpListen.


== gorankusu

https://sr.ht/~shulhan/gorankusu/[Gorankusu^]
is web user interface to test HTTP and/or WebSocket endpoints including for
load testing.

Last year we rename the project from "trunks" to "gorankusu"
The original idea of "trunks" is because the core library that we
use for load testing is named "vegeta" (from Dragon Ball), and
Vegeta has a son named Trunks.
In English, trunks have multiple meanings.
In order to have a unique name, we rename the project to "gorankusu",
which is a combination of "go" (the main programming language
that built the application) and "torankusu" the Hepburn of "Trunks".

This project has 59 commits with four releases.

* gorankusu v0.5.0 (2024-02-08)
+

** Allow submit free form request body in HTTPTarget
** Implement form input file
** Add type to customize how to dump HTTP request and response
** Support parameter binding in HTTP Path
** check HTTP response status greater or equal 400

* gorankusu v0.6.0 (2024-03-05)
** Changes Opts to non-pointer
+
Previously, we use pointer to indicated that the Target can be
attacked or not. Since HTTPTarget now have AllowAttack, this options
can be changes to non-pointer.

** Change the signature of default request/response dumper
+
Instead of function that use the signature of HTTPRequestDumper/
HTTPResponseDumper; change it to function that return HTTPRequestDumper/
HTTPResponseDumper. In this way, the documentation can show the clear
relation between function and its type.

** Add global HTTP headers for Target
+
The Headers field on Target define the global headers that will be
send along with all HTTPTarget or WebSocketTarget. The same header can
also be defined on HTTPTarget that override the value of Target.

** Add default HTTPRunHandler
+
Previously, the default HTTPRunHandler is hidden, called dynamically
based on Run is nil or not. This changes make it exported as function
that return HTTPRunHandler to show how define and create a custom
HTTPRunHandler.

** Add default HTTPParamsConverter for [HTTPTarget.ParamsConverter]
+
--
The DefaultParamsConverter define default function to convert
[HTTPTarget.Params] to its equivalent parameters in HTTP, either as
query in URL or as bytes in body.

This changes introduce breaking changes in HTTPTarget where field
ConvertParams renamed to ParamsConverter.
--

** Set default HTTPTarget Attack if its not set
+
--
Previously, the function for Attack need to be coded manually.

This changes introduce new function DefaultHTTPAttack that generate
HTTPAttackHandler based on the HTTPTarget method, request type, and
Params; if AllowAttack is true and Attack is nil.
--

** Fix null navigation links
+
If the navLinks fields is empty, the HTTP API will return "null" and
cause the rendering error. This changes fix this issue by allocating
the slice navLinks with one capabilities to make JSON always return
"[]" if its empty.


* gorankusu v0.6.1 (2024-04-06)
+
This release replace "share" module with "pakakeh.go".
The "share" module repository has been moved to SourceHut with new name
"pakakeh.go". For more information about the changes see pakakeh.go
project at https://sr.ht/~shulhan/pakakeh.go.


* gorankusu v0.7.0 (2024-09-07)
** Refactoring form input for multipart form-data
+
This changes replace handling type for storing multipart form-data
from "map[string][]byte" to [*multipart.Form] based on changes on
module "pakakeh.go".

** Make HTTP Target Params works along with WithRawBody
+
Previously, if WithRawBody is true, the Params will not be rendered
and parsed during Run. This changes makes the Params works along with
WithRawBody. If Params are set it will be rendered along with text area
for raw body.

** Support HTTP target with content type "text/html"
+
In the Target form, user can select to send body as "text/html".

** Add git.sr.ht APIs into example
+
The APIs is created using https://man.sr.ht/git.sr.ht/api.md as
reference. We also needs the API to create webhook since no other way
to create it in current sourcehut web.

** Fix save on null Headers and Vars
+
If the user does not define the Headers, clicking Run on any HTTP
Target will result in error when "save" function executed before it.

** Fix form input type file where content is binary
+
If the file in FormInput is binary, the conversion to
"FormInput.value" will fail with an error like "invalid characters in
String".

** Use [route.Path] to generate parameters
+
Using [route.String] does not works if the parameter can be empty,
while [route.Path] replace all keys and return the path as is.

** Add task to initialize the repository and tools
+
The task "init" include initializing git submodule, installing third
party tools for linters, and installing node packages.


== gotp

https://sr.ht/~shulhan/gotp/[gotp^]
is a command line interface to manage and generate Time-based One Time
Password (TOTP).

This project has 21 commits and two releases, with the following notable
features and bug fixes,

* gotp v0.5.0 (2024-02-08)
** Make the path to private key static
+
Instead of prompting user, make the private key static, located at
"$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/gotp/gotp.key".

** Ask for passphrase when removing or renaming label
+
Even though rename does not read the encrypted secret, as long as the
private key is in use, it should ask for passphrase.
The remove operation allow only the one that know the private key can
modify the issuer.

** Fix the bash completion installation directory
+
In the POSIX system, the correct installation for bash completion
script should be /usr/share/bash-completion not under /etc
directory.

* gotp v0.6.0 (2024-06-22)
** Fix failed `generate` command.
+
If the base32 hash is in lower-case, the `generate` command failed to print
the TOTP.

** Replace module "share" with "pakakeh.go".
+
The "share" module has been moved to moved from GitHub, to sourcehut, under
different name.

** Implement command "export"
+
--
The "export" command export all issuers to file or standard output,

	$ gotp export <FORMAT> [FILE]

List of known supported FORMAT is: uri.
If FILE is not defined it will print to standard output.
The list of exported issuers are printed in order of its label.

== karajo

https://sr.ht/~shulhan/karajo[karajo^]
karajo is HTTP workers and manager for continuous integration and/or
deployment, works and manageable with HTTP.
This project has 41 and four releases.

* karajo v0.9.0 (2024-02-08)

** Refactoring JobExec APIs to have "_exec" suffix
+
In JobHttp, we have "_http" suffix for its HTTP APIs.
To make it consistent we changes the HTTP API path to have "_exec" suffix.

** Apply default revive suggestions
+
--
I prefer zero configuration rather that creating exclusions,
like "revive.toml" file that we have earlier, even thought it will cause
breaking changes to our APIs.

Some breaking changes, [Env.HttpJobs] become [Env.HTTPJobs]
[Env.HttpTimeout] become [Env.HTTPTimeout],
[Env.HttpJobs] become [Env.HTTPJobs], and many more.
--

** Implement API to cancel running job
+
--
In the JobBase we add method Cancel to cancel running JobExec or JobHTTP.
In the HTTP server, we add endpoint "POST /karajo/api/job_exec/cancel"
to cancel JobExec by its ID.
Implements: https://todo.sr.ht/~shulhan/karajo/1
--

** Export the HTTP server field in Karajo
+
By exporting the HTTP server field, user of Karajo can register
additional HTTP endpoints without creating new HTTP server instance.

** Always call finish even if the job is paused
+
This is to make the [JobBase.NextRun] always set to next interval or
schedule.
Fixes: https://todo.sr.ht/~shulhan/karajo/2

** Set systemd unit to start after network.target
+
This is to fix karajo failed to start because the DNS has not working
yet when initializing email notification.


* karajo v0.9.1 (2024-04-06)
** env: remove [rand.Seed] usage
+
The [ascii.Random] generate random using "crypto/rand", so no need to
seed it anymore.

+
The "share" module repository has been moved to SourceHut, with new
name "pakakeh.go".


* karajo v0.9.2 (2024-09-08)
** make: fix file permissions when installing public index.html
+
Using 0640 (where user and group owner set to root) cause karajo
serviceâ€”that run as karajo userâ€”unable to read the file.


* karajo v0.9.3 (2024-12-08)

** env: fix missing ini tag on IsDevelopment field::

** Fix permission of "/srv/karajo"
+
The content of directory "/srv/karajo" may contains files served to
public, even internal, so it should be accesible by other user or
group.

** Return and show the current version in API environment and main page

** Set the module Version during build
+
The Version information is derived from latest tag and commit hash.
This allow command "karajo version" and user interface show on which
version its currently run.

* share v0.53.0 (2024-02-04)

** test/mock: implement mock for crypto [rand.Reader]
+
--
The RandReader implement [io.Reader].
To provide predictable result, the RandReader is seeded with slice of
bytes.
A call to Read will fill the passed bytes with those seed.

For example, given seed as "abc" (length is three), calling Read with
bytes length five will return "abcab".
--

** lib/sql: add new type Meta
+
Meta contains the DML meta data, including driver name, list of column
names, list of column holders, and list of values.
The Meta type replace the Row type.

** lib/path: new package to work with path
+
--
The path package provide a new type Route, detached from "lib/http".

A Route represent a parsed path.
A path can have a key, or binding, that can be replaced with string
value.
For example, "/org/:user/:repo" have two keys "user" and "repo".

Route handle the path in case-insensitive manner.
--

** _bin/go-mod-tip: use committer timestamp instead of author timestamp
+
If the tip is rebased to upstream, the author timestamp is not
changes, but the commit timestamp changes.

** lib/totp: add method GenerateWithTime and GenerateNWithTime
+
The GenerateWithTime and GenerateNWithTime accept parameter
[time.Time] as the relative time for generated password.

** lib/http: add support for If-Modified-Since in HandleFS
+
If the node modification time is less than requested time value in
request header If-Modified-Since, server will response with
304 Not Modified.

** lib/http: refactoring Range request, limit content served by server
+
--
When server receive,

  GET /big
  Range: bytes=0-

and the requested resources is quite larger, where writing all content
of file result in i/o timeout, it is best practice [1][2] if the
server write only partial content and let the client continue with the
subsequent Range request.

In the above case, the server should response with,

  HTTP/1.1 206 Partial content
  Content-Range: bytes 0-<limit>/<size>
  Content-Length: <limit>

Where limit is maximum packet that is reasonable [3] for most of the
client.
In this server we choose 8MB as limit.
--

** lib/http: add method Head to Client
+
The Head method send the HEAD request to path, with optional
headers, and params in query parameters.

** lib/ini: add method Keys
+
The Keys method return sorted list of all section, subsection, and
variables as string where each of them separated by ":", for example
"section:sub:var".


* share v0.53.1 (2024-03-02)

** lib/sql: handle binding with the same name
+
If [Meta.Bind] is called with the same name again, it should replace
the existing named value.

** lib/dns: ignore invalid message
+
--
If Query return a message but the failed to unpack due to invalid
format, for example

    unpackOPT: data length is out of range

ignore it instead of disconnect the client connection.
--

** lib/http: export function to generate "multipart/form-data"
+
The GenerateFormData generate the request body with boundary for
HTTP content-type "multipart/form-data" from map[string][]byte.

** lib/dns: change the log mechanism by mode instead of by level
+
--
This changes introduce three mode of debug:

* DebugLevelDNS: log error on DNS level, in example empty answer,
  ERR_NAME (domain name is invalid or not known) and so on.
* DebugLevelCache: log cache operations.
* DebugLevelConnPacket: log low level connection and package,
  including request and response.
--


* pakakeh.go v0.54.0 (2024-04-04)
+
--
This is the first release after we move the repository to SourceHut
under different name: "pakakeh.go".
There are several reasons for moving and naming.

First, related to the name of package.
We accidentally name the package with "share" a common word in English
that does not reflect the content of repository.
By moving to other repository, we can rename it to better and unique
name, in this "pakakeh.go".
Pakakeh is Minang word for tools, and ".go" suffix indicate that the
repository related to Go programming language.

Second, supporting open source.
The new repository is hosted under sourcehut.org, the founder is known
to support open source, and all their services are licensed under AGPL,
unlike GitHub that are closed sources.

Third, regarding GitHub CoPilot.
https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#4-license-grant-to-us[The GitHub Terms of Service],
allow any public content that are hosted there granted them to parse the
content.
On one side, GitHub helps and flourish the open source, but on another
side have an issues
https://githubcopilotinvestigation.com[issues]
regarding scraping the copyleft license.
--

* pakakeh.go v0.55.0 (2024-05-04)

** lib/http: refactoring "multipart/form-data" parameters in ClientRequest
+
--
Previously, ClientRequest with type RequestTypeMultipartForm pass the
type "map[string][]byte" in Params.
This type hold the file upload, where key is the file name and []byte
is content of file.
Unfortunately, this model does not correct because a
"multipart/form-data" can contains different field name and file name,
for example

  --boundary
  Content-Disposition: form-data; name="field0"; filename="file0"
  Content-Type: application/octet-stream

  <Content of file0>

This changes fix this by changing the parameter type for
RequestTypeMultipartForm to [*multipart.Form], which affect several
functions including [Client.PutFormData] and [GenerateFormData].

** lib/dns: fix packing and unpacking OPT record
+
The RDATA in OPT records can contains zero or more options.
Previously, we only handle unpacking and packing one option, now we
handle multiple options.

** telegram/bot: fix Webhook URL registration
+
Using [path.Join] cause "https://domain" become "https:/domain"
which is not a valid URL. This bug caused by refactoring in b89afa24f.

** lib/memfs: set embed file mode to print as octal
+
Using octal in mode make the embedded code more readable, for
example mode with permission "0o644" much more readable than 420".

** telegram/bot: register GET endpoint to test webhook
+
The call to get "GET <Webhook.URL.Path>/<Token>" will return HTTP
status 200 with JSON body '{"code":200,"message":"OK"}'.
This endpoint is to check if the bot server is really running.

** lib/http: allow all HTTP method to generate HTTP request with body
+
Although the RFC 7231 says that no special defined meaning for a
payload in GET, some implementation of HTTP API sometimes use GET with
content type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".

** lib/http: add new function [CreateMultipartFileHeader]
+
The CreateMultipartFileHeader help creating [multipart.FileHeader]
from raw bytes, that can be assigned to [*multipart.Form].


* pakakeh.go v0.55.1 (2024-06-20)

** lib/http: add request type HTML
+
The RequestTypeHTML define the content type "text/html".

** lib/path: add method Path to Route
+
Unlike String method that may return the keyâ€™s name in returned
path, the Path method return the path with all the keys has been
substituted with values, even if its empty.


* pakakeh.go v0.55.2 (2024-07-22)

** lib/memfs: sanitize the Root directory to fix refresh
+
In [MemFS.refresh], if the requested url is "/file1" and [Options.Root]
is ".", the path during refresh become "file1" and if passed to
[filepath.Dir] it will return ".". This cause the loop on refresh
never end because there is no PathNodes equal with ".".


* pakakeh.go v0.56.0 (2024-08-04)

** cmd/emaildecode: CLI to decode email body to plain text
+
The emaildecode accept file as input. If the email header contains
content-transfer-encoding with value quoted-printable or base64, it will
decode the message body and print it to stdout as plain text.

** lib/memfs: another fix for refresh
+
In previous commit we use wrong condition when handling directory
"." as Root.

** lib/email: allow message that end lines with LF only
+
Although, a message from network must end with CRLF, a message from
(another) client may have been sanitized and end with LF only.

** lib/email: decode the message body based on content-transfer-encoding
+
After the header and body has been parsed, if the header contains
Content-Transfer-Encoding, we decode the body into its local formats.
Currently supported encoding is "quoted-printable" and "base64".

** lib/email: export the Header fields
+
By exporting the fields, this allow the caller to filter or manage
the field manually.

** _doc: add partial note and summary for RFC 2183
+
The RFC 2183 is define Content-Disposition header field in the
internet message.

** lib/ini: mention that marshaling []byte does not supported
+
Due to "byte" is considered as "uint8" during reflection, we cannot
tell whether the value is slice of byte of slice of number with type
uint8.


* pakakeh.go v0.57.0 (2024-09-03)

** lib/sql: replace [http.FileSystem] with [memfs.MemFS]
+
--
Accepting the [http.FileSystem] means that the parameter can receive
an instance of [embed.FS], but in most cases, it will fail.

Case example, when we embed SQL files for migration under
"db/migration" using the "go:embed" directive,

	//go:embed db/migration/*.sql
	var DBMigrationFS embed.FS

and then call the [Migrate] function, it will not find any ".sql"
files inside the "/" directory because the files is stored under
"db/migration/" prefix (also there is no "/" when using embed.FS).
--

** lib/memfs: document the comparison with "go:embed" directive
+
--
Compare it to "go:embed", the memfs package is more flexible and
portable. Currently, we found three disadvantages of using "go:embed",

* The "go:embed" only works if files or directory to be embedded is
  in the same parent directory.
* Accessing the embedded file require the original path.
* No development mode.

None of those limitation affected the memfs package.
--


* pakakeh.go v0.58.0 (2024-10-06)
+
This release update the minimum Go module to 1.22.0, the last version
supported by Go tools.

**  lib/http: remove writing StatusNoContent on ResponseTypeNode
+
To make it consistent with RequestTypeNone, the ResponseTypeNone
should not write any response header or HTTP status code. It will be
handled manually by [Endpoint.Call].

**  lib/play: new package for formatting and running Go code
+
Package play provides callable APIs and HTTP handlers to format and
run Go code, similar to Go playground, but using HTTP instead of
WebSocket.

**  lib/http: add Server method to register handler by function
+
--
The RegisterHandleFunc register a pattern with a handler, similar to
[http.ServeMux.HandleFunc]. The pattern follow the Go 1.22 format:

	[METHOD] PATH

The METHOD is optional, default to GET. The PATH must not contains
the domain name and space. Unlike standard library, variable in PATH
is read using ":var" not "{var}". This endpoint will accept any
content type and return the body as is; it is up to the handler to
read and set the content type and the response headers.

If the METHOD and/or PATH is already registered it will panic.
--

**  lib/bytes: add function AppendInt64 and AppendUint64
+
The AppendInt64 append an int64 value into slice of byte. The
AppendUint64 append an uint64 value into slice of byte.


* pakakeh.go v0.58.1 (2024-12-07)

** lib/play: add custom request to run unsafe directory directly
+
--
As exceptional, the Run and HTTPHandleRun accept the following
request for running program inside custom "go.mod",

  {
    "unsafe_run": <path>
  }

The "unsafe_run" define the path to directory relative to HTTP
server working directory. Once request accepted it will change the
directory into "unsafe_run" first and then run "go run ." directly.
Go code that executed inside "unsafe_run" should be not modifiable and
safe from mallicious execution.
--

** lib/play: add option to Run with specific Go version and without race
+
The idea is to allow testing Go code on specific Go version.
For example, before Go 1.22, the for loop with variable is shared
among block statements, which cause every use of that variable is run
with the last value.

** lib/play: expose the Timeout variable
+
By exposing the Timeout, user can set their maximum time the program
can run in their playground.


* pakakeh.go v0.59.0 (2025-01-06)
+
--
This is the first release of pakakeh.go on the year 2025. There are many
new features and cleaning up, including packages that merged into single
package with help of type parameters.

The first major changes is indicated by using "go 1.23.4" as minimum Go
version in this module, to allow us using new packages like "slices" and
"maps".

In this release notes, we try new format. Instead of grouping each
changes by Breaking changes, New features, Bug fixes, Enhancements,
and/or Chores; we group them by package. Each paragraph in the package
sections will be prefixed with tag "[BREAKING CHANGE]", "[NEW FEATURE]",
"[BUG FIX]", "[ENHANCEMENT]", "[CHORE]" to indicates the type of
changes.
--

** lib/binary
+
--
The "lib/binary] is new package that complement the standard binary
package.

[NEW FEATURE]
Implement append-only binary that encode the data using [binary.Writer].
We call them "Apo" for short.

[NEW FEATURE]
Implement buffer for reading/writing in BigEndian. The BigEndianBuffer
provides backing storage for writing (most of) Go native types into
binary in big-endian order. The zero value of BigEndianBuffer is an
empty buffer ready to use.

The following basic types are supported for Write and Read: bool, byte,
int, float, complex, and string. The slice and array are also supported
as long as the sliceâ€™s element type is one of basic types.
--

** lib/bytes
+
[BREAKING CHANGE]
In the "lib/bytes" we split the hexdump related functions to separate
package, "lib/hexdump".

** lib/floats64
+
[BREAKING CHANGE]
This package has been removed, merged into "slices" package.

** lib/hexdump
+
--
[NEW FEATURE]
Package hexdump implements reading and writing bytes from and into
hexadecimal number. It support parsing output from hexdump(1) tool.
--

** lib/http
+
--
[NEW FEATURE]
In the [lib/http.Client] we add new method Transport that return default
HTTP Transport. The returned [http.Transport] is created after the
Client instantiated. Their value can be customized by user when needed,
which should affect the Transport inside the Client.
--

** lib/ints
+
--
[BREAKING CHANGE]
This package has been removed, merged into "slices" package.
--

** lib/ints64
+
--
[BREAKING CHANGE]
This package has been removed, merged into "slices" package.
--

** lib/memfs
+
--
[ENHANCEMENT]
In the "lib/memfs" we refactoring the Watch method to use the new
"watchfs/v2" package.

[BREAKING CHANGE]
The old Watcher and DirWatcher types now moved to watchfs package. This
changes require exporting method [memfs.MemFS.UpdateContent].
--

** lib/numbers
+
--
[CHORE]
In the package level, we remove unused README and LICENSE files. This
package README has been merged into the package documentation and the
LICENSE is same with the module one.

We also remove some package documentation that should be in
"lib/slices".
--

** lib/play
+
--
[NEW FEATURE]
The [lib/play] now has function and HTTP handler to run Go test code.
Since the test must run inside the directory that contains the Go file
to be tested, the [HTTPHandleTest] API accept the following request
format,

{
	"goversion": <string>,
	"file": <string>,
	"body": <string>,
	"without_race": <boolean>
}

The "file" field define the path to the "_test.go" file, default to
"test_test.go" if its empty. The "body" field contains the Go code that
will be saved to "file". The test will run, by default, with "go test
-count=1 -race $dirname" where "$dirname" is the path directory to the
"file" relative to where the program is running. If "without_race" is
true, the test command will not run with "-race" option.

[ENHANCEMENT]
On package level, the home and cache directory now initialized on
package init since there are never changes when program running. If Go
failed to get the home and cache it will be set to system temporary
directory.

[ENHANCEMENT]
We also simplify running Go code by removing the field pid in the struct
command that wait for process ID. Instead we execute cmd with Run
directly. In the Run function, we use the UnsafeRun to store temporary
directory and move the statements that writes go.mod and main.go into
the method writes of Request. This remove unnecessary unsafeRun
function.
--

** lib/reflect
+
--
[BREAKING CHANGE]
This release changes the Equal signature from "Equal(v any) bool" to
"Equal(v any) error". The reason for this changes is to force the method
to return an error message that is understand-able by caller.
--

** lib/slices
+
--
[NEW FEATURE]
Package "lib/ints", "lib/ints64", and "lib/floats64" are merged into
"slices". Now that Go has type parameter, we can use it to use the same
function that accept different types for working with slice of int,
int64, and float64.
--

** lib/ssh
+
--
[ENHANCEMENT]
In the lib/ssh, we implement Run with context internally. Instead of
depends on fork of crypto with CL that needs proposal, we implement them
in here so we can update crypto module to the latest release.
--

** lib/watchfs
+
--
The watchfs package now contains the original, v1, of the Watcher and
DirWatcher types from "lib/memfs".
--

** lib/watchfs/v2
+
--
[NEW FEATURE]
The "lib/watchfs/v2" is the new package that implement new file and
directory watcher, that replace the Watcher and DirWatcher in the
"lib/memfs".

The new implementation, FileWatcher, much more simple than what we have
in [memfs.Watcher].

The new directory watcher, DirWatcher, scan the content of directory in
[fs.DirWatcherOptions.Root] recursively for the files to be watched,
using the [fs.DirWatcherOptions.Includes] field. A single file,
[fs.DirWatcherOptions.FileWatcherOptions.FilePath], will be watched for
changes that trigger re-scanning the content of Root recursively.

The result of re-scanning is list of the Includes files (only files not
new directory) that are changes, which send to channel C. On each
[os.FileInfo] received from C, a deleted file have [os.FileInfo.Size]
equal to [NodeFlagDeleted]. The channel send an empty slice if no
changes.

The implementation of file changes in this code is naive, using loop and
comparison of mode, modification time, and size; at least it should
works on most operating system.
