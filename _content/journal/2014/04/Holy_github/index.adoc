=  Holy Github!

I use git to keep tracks of my home configuration and github as my backup
server.
Accidentally, today, when I run diff on my home directory with my git
configuration backup I found that my .gitconfig option "[sendemail]" has been
changed, and ...

Oh, wait ...

What if someone also do this on github?

So, I go to github and search for "smtppass". I found some repository with
`smtppass` filled in.

Here is a result that I tried and working,

Holy github!

**Update:** I have inform github support about this, and here is the reply
from one of their staff.
