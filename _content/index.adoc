https://golang-id.org[golang-id.org,target=_blank]::
This website is my second contribution to Go community.
Its goal is not only to provide help, through translation, for Indonesian to
learn more about Go but also to provide an ecosystem for Indonesian Go
community, for example, vlog and blog in Indonesian language, and sharing open
source works written in Go.
The website is freshly launched, they are still more works to be done, though.
