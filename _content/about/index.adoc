=  About
:toc:

The man is a merchant.
He have a shop in second floor market on a small city.
He sell a fabric for men and women clothing.
At nine or ten in the morning he goes to his shop, unpack all the goods,
rolling the display, to make some space inside the shop so customer can walk
and view the goods.
At night, he pack all the goods back and close the shop.
He does this every day.
No weekend.

The man has a junior.
Unlike other people in their small city, the junior does not understand the
concept of bargaining.
He a little bit shy and have a small tendencies to pursue one thing until he
good at it, psychologist label it as disorder (does not we all?)
He think that selling goods should have a price tag, so customer does not need
to ask every time he want to know the price of goods in the shop.
This make everything simple.
The junior then decide to become an engineer.
And so he become a software engineer.

I believe that the future of software is open source.

People changes ... or bored, hardware changes.
In closed source system the changes is either slow or steady depends on the
maker resources.
If one maker tried to cope up with their ecosystem,
other makers who have more resources or better idea can make the same software
with a greater look and performance.
Eventually one of the maker will die or born again with new skin and body.
Just like the circle of life.
This is also why human is doomed.
Every new born does not automatically have knowledges of their ancestors.
They must learn again and again and again.
But, machine made everything simple, even learning.
Only human that does not learned who will doomed.

If the makers keep doing this, we will just reiterating the same thing
again and again, wasting resources for the sake of competition and margin.
On one side this is good, giving jobs to the market, making the money flow.
But on the scale of future, where human only have an average 60 to 70 years
lifespan, this is definitely wasting of resources.

When developing software I have a high standard, clean code and stable
program.
The main principles that I always keep is “Stable, Simple, Speed, and
Secure”.
Stable, always manage to deliver no-crash program;
every modules and functions of program should be tested.
Simple, software should be easy to be configured and easy to use.
Speed, having a knowledge on the cause of slow in a program and how to make it
faster with a better solution and algorithms.
Secure, know how to avoid security problems the right ways.

==  Educational Backgrounds

===  Master's degree from Institut Teknologi Bandung

Department:: School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics

Majors:: Business Intelligence

Period:: 2013 - 2016

Thesis:: Detecting Vandalism on English Wikipedia Using LNSMOTE Resampling and
Cascaded Random Forest Classifier

Development:: The program is written using Go on GNU/Linux operating system.

Abstract:: Wikipedia.org is an online encyclopedia which can edited by anyone.
Those feature has benefit, which make the article in Wikipedia rapidly
increased in size and can be fixed subsequently, and their drawbacks was prone
to vandalism in the forms of invalid information, deletion, ads, or
meaningless content.
This paper propose a framework for detecting vandalism on English Wikipedia
using machine learning technique by training Cascaded Random Forest (CRF)
classifier on English Wikipedia dataset (PAN-WVC-10) that has been resampled
using Local Neighbourhood SMOTE (LNSMOTE).
Those two methods then compared with Random Forest (RF) for classifier and
SMOTE for resampling.
The result of training both classifiers that has been tested on Wikipedia
Vandalism Corpus 2011 (PAN-WVC-11) English only dataset showed that the
dataset resampled using LNSMOTE have true-positive rate better than SMOTE.
CRF on LNSMOTE with 200 stages and 1 tree gave the better result among others
with true-positive rate value 0.9904.
From training computation time, CRF 1.6 times faster than RF in resampled
dataset.
